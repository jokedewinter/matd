Explanation of Key Parts:

1. HTML Drag-and-Drop:

- We create a div (#dragArea) that serves as the drag-and-drop area.
- The div's appearance changes when the user drags a file over it.

2. File Upload and Font Handling:

- When a file is dropped, we access the first file (fontFile) using event.dataTransfer.files.
- We use the FileReader API to read the font file as a Data URL. This allows us to dynamically load the font into the page.

3. Dynamically Adding @font-face:

- Once the font file is read, we create a new <style> element that includes the @font-face rule.
- The font is loaded using the url() function, pointing to the Data URL generated by FileReader.

4. Font Format:

- The @font-face rule uses format('woff2') in the example, but you can modify the format to fit the font type you are using (e.g., woff, truetype, opentype).


5. Test Your Implementation

- Open the HTML file in a browser.
- Drag a font file (e.g., example-font.woff2) from your file system into the designated area.
- The font should load and apply to the sample text, displaying it using the custom font.

Notes:

- Ensure that the font file you're uploading is of a compatible format (woff, woff2, ttf, etc.).
- This example uses readAsDataURL() to load the font, which is suitable for most modern browsers. However, the font size may be limited by the browser when embedding via a data URL.

This approach gives you a basic dynamic font loader with drag-and-drop functionality!
